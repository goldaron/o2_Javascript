                Task: prompt the user for five numbers and print them in the reverse order
                they were entered (this is not sorting, but reversing the entry order).

                Notes:
                - Prompt the user five times and store each entry in an array.
                - After collection, iterate the array from the last index down to 0 and
                    print each element to the console.
                - Do not use Array.prototype.reverse() — use a for-loop to iterate backwards.
                - For this exercise prompt() is acceptable; the values will be logged
                    to the console for verification.
