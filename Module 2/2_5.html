        <!--
                Task: prompt the user for numbers and stop when a number that was
                previously entered is entered again. Then print all previously given
                numbers in ascending order.

                Notes:
                - Use prompt() repeatedly to collect numbers from the user.
                - Convert prompt responses to numbers (parseFloat) before storing.
                - When a duplicate is detected (numbers.includes(num)), report it and
                    stop collecting inputs.
                - Finally, sort the collected numbers numerically and print them.
