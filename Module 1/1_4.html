    <title>You're a Wizard</title>
<!-- In the Harry Potter children's books, the sorting hat assigns a new student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
and Wizardry to one of the four classes, which are Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. 
Write an electronic sorting hat that asks for a student's name and draws a room for that student. 
If you enter Anna as the name, for example, the program prints to the HTML document "Anna, you are Ravenclaw." (3p)
Hints:
Use math.random() to draw a value (1, 2, 3 or 4)
Once the number is drawn, you need to use a multiple choice structure (if, else if, ..., else or switch).
