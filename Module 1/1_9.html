<!-- Write a program that asks the user for an integer and tells if the number is a prime number. (2p)

Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and itself.
For example, number 13 is a prime number as it can only be divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.
On the other hand, number 21 for example is not a prime number as it can be also be divided by numbers 3 and 7.
Print the result on the HTML document.-->
